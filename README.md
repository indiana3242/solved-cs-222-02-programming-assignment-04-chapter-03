In each Pez plastic container of Pez candy, the colors are stored in random order.  Frank’s little brother, Phil, likes only the yellow ones, so he painstakingly takes out all the candies one by one, eats the yellow ones, and keeps the others in order, so that he can return them to the container in exactly the same order as before – minus the yellow candies.  Write a program to simulate this process.  You are REQUIRED TO USE A STACK TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  Use the following colors for the candy: Red, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Purple.  Figure out how to determine the color order.  Display the candy colors as they come out of the Pez dispenser and as they are put back.
